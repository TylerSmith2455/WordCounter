Project Name: Word Counter
Author: Tyler Smith

Purpose: This program reads a text file in from the standard input.
	 The program will then print the words in alphabetical order.
         After the words are printed in alphabetical order,
	 they are then printed from greatest occurrences to least occurrences.
         This allows the user to see how many times each word is used.

How it Works: The program reads a text file in from the standard input.
              It discards punctuation and spacing, except for an underscore.
	      If a word has punctuation, the program splits the word into two.
	      These words are then inserted into a hash table to easily keep track of each
	      word and the amount of times they are used. In case two different words have
              the same hash value, a linked list is kept to hold those words.
              The words are then sorted both alphabetically and numerically using quick sort.
	      After being sorted, the words are printed first alphabetically with their word count,
	      and then numerically with their word count.
